Welcome to --=Congressman Find=--
Congressman Find is a command line interface to discover current information about the members and committees of the United States Congress.  Using information from ProPublica's excellent Congress API it can display representatives and senators based on location or committee and deliver the contact information of their offices and social media accounts.

The project was started in 2017 by Sebstian Royer and Lindsay Davis as a Flatiron School project, and is open to volunteer contirbution.

It is currently maintained by Lindsay Davis and Sebastian Royer.

--=Installation=--
Congressman Find is written in Ruby and can be used by cloning down a copy of the project as it has not been packaged into an installable as of yet.  From there it can be run with ruby from the bin/run.rb file.

It was built and tested with Ruby 2.3.3.  Library dependancies can be installed via bundle install and bundle update.
