##--=Congressman Find=--
Congressman Find is a command line interface to discover current information about the members and committees of the United States Congress.  Using information from [ProPublica's excellent Congress API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) it can display Representatives and Senators based on location or committee and deliver the contact information of their offices and social media accounts.

The project was started in 2017 by [Lindsay Davis](https://github.com/L-A-Davis) and [Sebstian Royer](https://github.com/walkingalchemy) as a [Flatiron School](www.flatironschool.com) project, and is open to volunteer contribution.

It is currently maintained by [Sebstian Royer](https://github.com/walkingalchemy) and [Lindsay Davis](https://github.com/L-A-Davis).
